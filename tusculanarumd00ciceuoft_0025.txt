compelled to determine at once for Latin, in order to make
the language a suitable vehicle sor abstract thought. This
very achievement many consider Cicero's noblest service
to letters, in fact the really great work of his life3 for by
this he made both Roman and mediaeval philosophy pos-
sible, and through these affected in no slight degree the
entire course of modern philosophical thought.

14. Before Cicero's time the Romans had but slight
acquaintance with Greek speculative thought. Carneades,
Critolaus, and Diogenes were sent by the Athenians as
envoys to Rome in 155 nc, but Cato, fearing that the new
learning would undermine the courage and integrity of
the Roman youth, prevailed upon the senate to order the
immediate return of the philosophers. At a later date the
Stoic Panaetius visited Rome and was cordially received
and entertained by the famous Seipionic circle. The poet
Lucretius· in his De Rerum lVatura expounded the philosophy
of Epicurus. Amafinius, Rabirius, and Catius discussed
the principles of the same school in works now lost, but
received with some degree of favor in their day, though
Cicero thought them unworthy of serious consideration.
Through these philosophers and the Greek teachers of less
note who flocked to Rome after Panaetius’ time, philosophy
gained a foothold in central Italy and secured a certain
following among the educated classes, but it was Cicero,
and he alone, who undertook to make known to the Romans
in their own tongue the doctrines of the four great schools,
to place, as it were, in their very hands almost the entire
body of Greek philosophy. For this service to his country-
men he merited their sincerest gratitude, and not theirs
only, but that of all Subsequent ages ; for his works have pre-
served and rendered accessible to us the choicest treasures
of Greek thought, much of which would otherwise have

remained unknown.
