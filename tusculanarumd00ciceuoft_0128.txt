100 Hectoris.

80 M. TVLLI CICERONIS

Vidi, videre quod me passa aegerrume,
Hectorem curru quadriiugo raptarier.

Quem Hectorem, aut quam diu ille erit Hector?
Melius Accius et aliquando sapiens Achilles:

I'mmo enimvero corpus Priamo re'ddidi,

Hectorem abstuli.

Non igitur Hectora traxisti, sed corpus, quod fuerat

dormire non sinat:

Ecce alius exoritur e terra qui matrem

Mate'r, te appello, tri, quae curam somno

suspensam levas,

Neque te mei miseret, surge et sepeli

natum —.

Haec cum pressis et flebilibus modis, qui totis theatris
maestitiam inferant, concinuntur, difficile est non eos,

qui inhumati sint, miseros iudicare.

vidi, etc.: from the Andromache
of Ennius. The measure is iambic
trimeter with an anapaest in fourth
place in the second verse. — passa:
sc. snm. — Hectorem: the long ὁ
in such Greek names belongs to
early Latin; cf. ΙΙ. 39 Hecto'ris,
and see Varr. L. L. X. 70 and
Quint. I. 5. 60. Hector, son of
Priam and Hecuba, and husband
of Andromache, was the bravest of
the Trojans.— raptarier: archaic
for raplari.—Accius: L. Accius
(born 170 Bc), ‘⁴ the link between
the ante-classical and Ciceronian
epochs‚” was known principally
as a writer of tragedies. See
68 n. — aliquando: see 1 n. ——
immo, etc.: probably from the
Epinausinmclze Of Accius. The
verse is trochaic septenarius3 the
first foot is a dactyl‚ enirn having

the second syllable short through
the backward influence of the
ictus vero.

106. ecce alius : Deiphilus,
son of Polymnestor‚ the Thracian
king, and Iliona, daughter of
Priam, was killed by his father, by
mistake, in place of Polydorus (son
of Priam), who had been sent to the
Thracian court to be brought up.
—mater, etc.: from the Iliona, a
tragedy by Pacuvius (220—132 Bc).
The measure is iambic octonarius,
with three trisyllabic feet in the
second verse; mei is read as a
monosyllable.—curarn . . . sus-
pensam, anxious cara—neque

. . miseret: a continuation of
the relative construction would
require ct quam mei non miseret.
—— pressis, slew. — totis theatris,
tlzc entire audience in tlte theater ,·
