19. In fixing, then, the time of composition of this work,
the only point of uncertainty is the date of its completion.
Some editors, prominent among them Schiche, (leny the
theory of Heine and claim that the work was finishecl
early in the second half of the year 45 ης. They <10
not believe that the word ἀνέκδοτον, in the letter referred
to above (ad Att. XIV. 17. 6), has any reference to the
'l‘usculan Disputations‚ and therefore think it has no bear-
ing whatever upon the date of completion. The direct refer-
ences to this treatise in the other letters of this month
indicate, they maintain, a more thorough acquaintance
with the work than Atticus could have possibly gained in
any brief period of time. Again, the omission of any word
concerning the death of Caesar, which Cicero hailed at
the time as the liberation of the state, they consider suf-
ficient proof that the books were written and published
before the Ides of March, 44 uc. To this latter argument
Heine rejoins that it was more dangerous to refer in
unfriendly terms to the Julian party after the Dictator's
assassination than before3 cf. ad Att. XIV. 17. 6 mium-e
periculo existimo contra illas msam'as partes vivo tyranno disi
potuisse quam mortuo,· see also XV. 4. 3. The contro-
versy, so far as any special importance is to be attached
to it, narrows itself down to this question: Was the work
published before or after Caesar's death? If after, it is
certainly difficult to account satisfactorily for Cicero’s
silence upon an event of such far-reaching importance and
of such persona] interest to himself.
