first edition the second book is preserved and gives the
speculations of Antiochus and l'hilo of the New Academy.
Of the second edition the principal fragment belongs to
the first book and gives the history of Academic opinion
from Plato to Arcesilas. This treatise is our chief source
of information in regard to Academic doctrines. The De
Finibus Bonorum et sllalormn gives the theories of the four
leading schools on the highest good and the greatest evil.
It deals with the fundamental questions of philosophy and
is one of the most important and best written of Cicero's
works. The Timaeus is a free translation os I'lato's dia-
logue on the Nature of the Universe, in which is given an
account of the mythical island Atlantis. The De Consola-
tione was called forth by the death of Cicero’s daughter
Tullia, to whom he was devotedly attached. The dia-
logues on Old Age and Friendship are masterpieces in
their particular field of practical ethics, and are entitled to
high rank in the world's best literature. The De Officiis,
based upon the Περὶ τοῦ Καθήκοντος of Panaetius, has been
pronounced the best practical treatise on human duties
produced by any pagan writer. In the De [Vatum Deorum
the Epicurean, Stoic‚ and Academic theories of the nature
and characteristics of the gods are set forth in dialogue
form. This work finds its natural continuation in the
De Divinatione, which contains the opposing views of
the Academics and Stoics on the science of divination.
Finally, supplementing the De Divinatione and completing
the list of religious or theological works, the De Fata gives
from the Academic point of view a criticism of the Stoic.
doctrine of Fate.
