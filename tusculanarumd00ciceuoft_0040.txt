essential for an. author's best work on a serious philo-
sophical theme. The dialogue, compared with that of
Cicero's other works, lacks persona] interest and dra-
matic force. The participants are designated by letters
merely. In the Calo llsaior one almost feels that Cato
himself, a vigorous Roman of the old school, is actually

on vital points, seem lacking in clearness and force. In
general, it may be said, the Tusculan Disputations show evi-

faults and blemishes‚ it has at the same time many of the
beauties and excellences that mark the style of the greatest

and Roman history. The variety of topics, the numerous
references to individua] philosophers and different schools
of thought, combined with the practica] bearing of the
