DATE oF COMPOSITION

18. In point of time the Tusculan Disputations followed
the De Finibus Bonorum ct Alalarum and preceded the De
Divinatione, as is clearly indicated by Cicero in the enu—
meration of his works(‹1'e Βίῳ. ΙΙ. 1). That it was later
than the De Fz‘m'lms is also shown by thsc. V. 32, where
the ancillor says: Quia legi tuum nuper quartum de Finibus.
This brings the time of composition within the limits of
the latter half of 45 and the first part of 44 B.c.; for the
De [finibus was completed in June, 45 13.c. In letters to
Atticus, May 29 of this same year, Cicero intimates that
he is already gathering material for the Tusculan Disputa-
tions; cf. adAlf. XIII. 31. 2; and 32. 2 Dicaearchi Περὶ Ψυχῆς
utrosque velim mittas et Καταβάσεως ; τριπολιτικὸν non invenio
et epistulam eius, quam ad Aristoxenum misit. Tres eos libros
maxime mm( vellem ,· apti essent ad id quod cogito. It is
probable, however, that he did not devote himself exclu-
sively to this task‚ but that its completion was somewhat
hindered by other duties ancl plans, especially by studies
preparatory to the De Natura Πίθωνι,- cf. ad Att. XIII.

In a letter to Atticus, May 4, 44 B.C., Cicero wrote: Librum
meum illum ἀνέκδοτον nondum, ut volui, perpolivi (ad Att.
XIV. 17. 6); which has been interpreted by Heine and
others as proving that the treatise was completed about
this time. That it was familiar to Atticus soon after
this is shown clearly by correspondence with the latter3
