CICERO’S SERVICES TO PHILOSOPHY

12. Cicero's sels-imposed task of revealing to his coun-
trymen the rich treasures of Greek philosophy involved
many serious difficulties. The Romans were not meta-

Greek language, with all its flexibility and polish, required
a long time for the full development of a philosophical
vocabulary. Such a vocabulary Cicero was practically
