fellow-citizens. The coloring and the spirit were to be
Roman, the fundamental principles and the groundwork
of the argument Greek. The question, then, in reference
to any particular work is: What authority did Cicero
follow and how did he use his material ? In the Tusculan
Disputations he refers to many writers, whose influence on
his work can, to some extent, be recognized. But what
particular book, if a single one, was his model, what phi-
losopher he followed chiefly, or what sources, original or
mere abridgments and compilations, he drew from, cannot
easily be determined. A careful study of the question has
been made by a number of scholars, but the conclusions
reached are not the same. Only a general outline of
Cicero’s sources as indicated in the text, with some of the
modern theories‚ can be given here.

the Stoics‚ notably Posidonius, from whom it is claimed came
many passages in which Stoic and Academic doctrines are
closely intermingled. The works of Plato, the Περὶ Πένθους
of 'Crantor the Academic, and the Κορινθιακοὶ of Dicae-

On the nature of the soul the opinions of various philoso-

of burial (ch. 45), Chrysippus is mentioned as an inter-
esting and important authority. In the second book Cicero
seems to have borrowed from the Peripatetics as well as
the Stoics; but the literary features of this book and the
rhetorical character of the discourse render any attempt
to trace philosophica] authorities exceedingly difficult. In
the third book the name of Crantor again appears; but the
principal authorities for this book, and for the fourth
also, were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus (Περὶ Παθῶιι),
Panaetius, and Posidonius. In the fifth and concluding
book of the treatise the Academy is represented by
