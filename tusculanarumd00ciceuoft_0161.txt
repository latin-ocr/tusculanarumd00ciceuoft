INTRODUCTION

THE DE REPVBLICA

1. Cicero wrote the De Republica, of which the Samnium
Scipionis forms the conclusion, at his villa near Cumae, 54
ss.c., —almost ten years before he published his works
in speculative and moral'philosophy. The incidents of
composition, including time, place, and source of material,
can be readily gathered from allusions in his correspond-

May, 54 iic, he hints at the pleasures and the difficulties
of his task and announces his intention of consigning his
book to the sea if it fails to meet his ideal a'nd justify
the time and labor spent upon it. Cf. ad Quint. ΙΙ. 12. 1

sententia successerit bene erit opera posita, siu minus, in illud
ipsum mare deiciemus quod spectantes scribimus, aggrediemur
αίία, quoniam quiescere nou possumus. The general scope of
the De Republica and the separate topics of discussion are
concisely stated in the Tusculan Disputations: de moribus
institutisque maiorum et disciplina ac temperatione civitatis . . .
aliis llaec locis satis accurate a nobis dicta suut maximeque iu
iis sex libris quos de republica scripsimus (IV. 1). C icero's
natural tastes led him to investigate the theory and founda-
tion of the state and to study the history and development
of civil government. His experience in public office and

his familiarity with the political writings of Plato, Aristone,
