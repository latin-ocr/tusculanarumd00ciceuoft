x'l INTRODUCTION

THE SOMNIVM SCIPIONIS

4. The Dream of Scipio was saved from the fate which
overtook the greater part of the De Republica. Although
it forms, as we have already seen, merely an episode in the
work, it has had to a large degree a separate and distinct
history. Its impressive character and striking form early
attracted attention and caused it to be reproduced in inde-
pendent editions. The preservation of the Dream to our
day is due to the antiquarian Macrobius, of the early part
of the fifth century, who wrote an elaborate commentary
upon it in two books. The text of the Somnium was
appended to this commentary and has come down to us

in various manuscripts of Macrobius' works. The most
important are the Paris (P) of the eleventh century, the

Bamberg (B) of the same period, and several at Munich

of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The text of the
Dream is not in the Vatican palimpsest. The introduc-

tion to the commentary of Macrobius includes a compari-
son of the two works of Cicero and Plato and a discussion
of the use of fables and the signifieance of dreams. In
the main body of the exposition the author selects special
passages of the Somnium and comments upon them, often
at great length, especially on the subject of “perfect
numbers,” the movements of the heavenly bodies, and
the immortality of the soul. In this way he introduces
many facts and speculations, some of which are interest-
ing and ingenious, while others seem to be forced upon
the text. Favonius Eulogius, a pupil of St. Augustine,
prepared a somewhat similar exposition, though not of
very great value. There is also a Greek translation of the
fourteenth century by Maximus Planudes.

ing part of the discussion, by the complaint of Laelius
