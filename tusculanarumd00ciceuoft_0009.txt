PREFACE

CICERo's Tusculan Disputations have not been very gen-

to say that in no other work has Cicero stated his belief in
the immortality of the soul in such distinct and definite
terms.

The text of both selections is based on that of C. F. W.
Muller (in the Teubner series). In a few instances other
readings have been preferred. Changes have also been made
in the punctuation, and in some words a more approved
spelling has been substituted. Departures from Miiller’s
text in the first book of the Tusculan Disputations have
been noted and explained in the Critical Appendix. The

In the commentaries many references and parallel pas-
sages have been introduced to make the argument clear or
