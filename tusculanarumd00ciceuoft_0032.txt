xxviii INTRODUCTION

discussion is given in the text (I. 7f.). Cicero with a
company of friends devotes five days to the consideration
of philosophical subjects, after the manner of the Greeks.
To give reality to the conversation and animation to the
argument, he adopts the dialogue form,—the plan fol-
lowed, in fact, in most of his philosophical works. A
member of the company proposes the topic for considera-
tion and expresses his own opinion in regard to it, which
Cicero then proceeds to refute. While conducting the
discussion he sits or walks about, as it pleases him (I. 8).
The morning of each day is taken up with rhetorical
themes, the asternoon with philosophical (cf. II. 9). In
most of his other works Cicero employed the Aristotelian
form of dialogue, in which, after a few preliminary ques-

interruption or suggestion on the part of his hearers. The
method here followed is called in the text the Socratic,
but it is not the exact Socratic form illustrated in the dia-
logues of Plato. It is true that the preliminary conver-

Amicitia, but the chief speaker soon passes from the rapid
interchange of question and answer to the development of
the special topic under consideration. In the De Natura
Deorum the form differs again, as each of the three schools,
Academic, Stoic, and Epicurean, has a separate speaker to
defend its views.

of personal names. A has been variously interpreted as

stand for Marcus, is now explained as magister, to corre-
spond with cmdt'tor. So far as can be determined by manu-
script authority, the letters were not in the original text,
but were inserted by a copyist. The discussion of each
