iv INTRODUCTION

Theophrastus, and the Peripatetics aided him materially in
presenting the results of his studies in the form of a prac-
tical and systematic treatise. Cf. de Div. ΙΙ. 3 Atque liis
libris adnumerandi simi sex de republica, quos tum scripsimus
cum gubernacula rei publicae tenebamus. Magnus locus philo-
sophiaeque proprius α Platone, Aristotele, Itzeoplzrasto totaque

work, furnished the model for Cicero, as it has likewise
done for many writers on kindred subjects in later times.

departed from Plato's plan in one important particular:
he considered the state not as an ideal communsty, but
as it was revealed to him in the records of history and as
he actually found it in his own experience. The Roman
commonwealth formed the basis of his discussion, and not

ostendero, quam si milii aliquam, iit apud Platonem Socrates,
ipse fiam-ero. Cicero’s plan had the merit of naturalness
and made possible the introduction of facts and impres-
sions acquired through actual contact with the problems
of government. To the entire treatise the semblance of
reality is given by the dialogue form, borrowed, as in all
of Cicero’s philosophica] writings, from the Greeks. The
views expressed and the counsel given seem to come from
the lips of living men who have themselves had a share in
the making of their country's history. The discussion is
represented as having taken place during the Latin holi-
days in the winter of 1²9 irc„ in the grounds of the home
of Scipio Africanus Minor. The host leads in the debate,
