disturbances (pcrfurbalioncs) of the mind. 'l'he thesis for
refutation is: Nm milti videtur amm ant'mi pffrlszrlmtz'am
posse sapiens vacare (IV. 8). The discussion is divided
into three main parts: the consideration of the four per-
turbations of the mind, aegritudo, laclilm, metus, and libido,
and their different forms and subdivision53 the refutation
of the thesis; and, finally, the remedies which philosophy

theories of certain schools and shows that the Stoics alone
are logical in their attitude toward this thesis, and by Stoic
arguments establishes his claim that virtue alone brings
happiness of the highest type. Cicero maintains that is
the Epicureans, with their peculias views of virtue and
happiness, hold that the wise man is always happy, much

are due to haste in writing. Cicero was not a philosopher
in the highest sense of the term and did not attempt to
develop a treatise complete in plan, perfect in arrangement,
and new and original in matter and theory. The circum-
stances under which he wrote were not the most favorable
for the repose of mind and calmness of deliberation so
