THE 'l'USCULAN IJISJ’UTATIONs
Tri-Li:

16. The Tusculanae Dispulassmu‘s were so named because
the discussions were represented as taking place at the
Tusculanum, Cicero’s favorite villa for retirement and study.
Of the commanding location of this country home and the
magnificent view it afforded, Merivale thus speaks: ‘⁶ From
the hill on which this villa stood the spectator surveyed a
wide and various prospect, rich at once in natural beauty
and historic associations. The plain at his feet was the
battle-field of the Roman kings and of the infant common-
wealth3 it was strown with the marble sepulchers of patri-
cians and consulars3 across it stretched the long straight
lines of the military ways which transported the ensigns of
conquest to Parthia and Arabia. . . . Before him lay far
outspread the mighty City, mistress of the world. ., . . The
statues of the gods exalted on pillars, or soaring above
the peaks of its innumerable temples‚ seemed an army of
immortals arrayed in defense of their eternal abodes.’⁷
Hist. I. pp. 303, 304.

17. The Latin grammarians often call the work simply
Tusculanae, and Tertullian (Apol. 50) refers to it in the same
manner. Some manuscripts of inferior rank give the title
as Tusculanae Quaestiones, and for a time it was thought
by many that this was the correct wording3 but the best
manuscripts, and in fact Cicero himself, seem to prove
beyond reasonable doubt that the correct title is Tuscu-
