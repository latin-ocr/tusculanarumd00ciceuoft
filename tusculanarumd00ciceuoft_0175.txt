SOMNIVM SCIl'lONIS 3

somno tale quale de Homero scribit Ennius, de quo
videlicet saepissime vigilans solebat cogitare et loqui)
Africanus se ostendit ea forma quae mihi ex imagine
eius quam ex ipso erat notior; quem ubi agnovi, equi-
dem cohorrui, sed ille ‘Ades’ inquit ‘animo et omitte
timorem, Scipio, et quae dicam trade memoriae.
Videsne illam urbem, quae parere populo Romano
coacta per me renovat pristina bella nec potest quie-
scere?' (ostendebat autem Karthaginem de excelso et
pleno stellarum, illustri et claro quodam loco) ‘ad quam

tu oppugnandam nunc venis paene miles.

Hanc hoc

biennio consul evertes, eritque cognomen id tibi per te

(animus) cum languore corporis
nec memhris uti ncc sensibus polest,
incidit in visa varia ct itlccrla cx
reliquiis, ut ait A risloleles, inlate*-
rentibus carum rernm quas szg‘i-
lans gesserit aut cogitaverit. — de
Homero . . . Ennius: Ennius
(239—169 Rc.) wrote an epic poem
in eighteen books, entitled Annales,
recounting the history of the
Romans from the time 01 Aeneas.
He is said to have believed that
he had received the spirit of
Homer through the transmigration
of souls. Cf. Acad. II. 51 (Ennius)
cum somniavit, ita narravit: . . .
visus Homerus adesse poeta ,· also
Hor. Ep. ῙΪ. 1. 5ο Ennius . . . alter
Homerus. — ex imagine: Roman
citizens had the right to preserve
in the atrium, the great hall of the
house, wax masks of ancestors
who had held curule magistra-
cies.—ex ipso . . . notior: the
younger Scipio was born 185 B.c.,
while the elder Africanus died
either in that year or two years
laten—ades . . . animo, calm
yourself, be brave. - trade memo-
riae, hand down, relate· Cf.

bella: the First and Second
Punic XVars.-—autem: on this
use of aulcm to introduce a pa-
renthesis, see Lane 1642; cf. 8
crat natvm—excelso . . . loco:
the Milky VVay; cf.8 orbem lac-
teum—paene miles: the mili-
tary tribunes were taken from
young men of senatorial or eques-
trian rank. The office was an
important one, but is here depreci-
ated in comparison with the con-
sulship, which Scipio was to have
two years later.—h0c biennio
. .. evertes: Scipio was consul
147 Bc. and proconsul 146 ΒΩ,
in which year he captured and
destroyed Carthage, and cele-
brated a splendid triumph in
Rome; cf. Liv. Epit. LII; Val.
Max. IV. 3. 13.—cognomen:
