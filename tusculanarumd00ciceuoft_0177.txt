SOMNIVM SCIl’lONIS 5

duoque ii numeri, quorum uterque plenus alter altera de
causa habetur, circuitu naturali summam tibi fatalem
confecerint, in te unum atque in tuum nomen se tota
convertet civitas, te senatus, te omnes boni, te socii, te
Latini intuebuntur, tu eris unus in quo nitatur civitatis
salus, ac, ne multa, dictator rem publicam constituas
Hic
cum exclamasset Laelius ingemuissentque vehementius

oportet, si impias propinquorum manus effugeris?

ceteri, leniter arridens Scipio ‘ St! quaeso' inquit, ‘ne me

e somno excitetis, et parumper audite cetera.‘

motion⁷' of the sun—quorum
uterque plenus . . . habetur: the
ancients regarded 8 as a perfect
number because it is the first cube
after ¹3 because 8 z 7 (perfect
number) -ἑ- 1 (uuity); also because
8 z 2 >< 4 (for which reason 8 was
taken as the Pythagorean symbol
for justice) ; for additional reasons
for calling 8 a complete number,
see Macrob. Som. δεξί’. 1. 5. 3-18.
Seven was considered a perfect
number for many reasons; e.g.‚
multiples of 7 are the climacterical
years in the life of man, 70 being
the natural limit of age (cf. Macrob.
Sam. Sczj). Ι. 6. 76 llaec a physicis
creditur meta vivendi, et lzoc vilae
humanae perfectum spatium termi-
nat1cr); 7 is ὲ of 28, the number
of days in the lunar month; the
human body in many parts of its
organism also seems to illustrate
the prominence of 7, ag. the 7
“openings” in the head for the
organs of sense; again, 7 is made
up of numbers that are also re-
garded as having certain special
and peculiar properties‚ 6 ÷ 1,

number. see Macrob. Som. Sczp.

anaphora; boni in the political
sense, optimates ,· instead of socii
Latini, as here, the more common
expression is socii et Latini (or
socii et nomen Latinum). It is
used to designate allthe Italians,
including the Latius, in alliance
with Rome. The landed pro-
prietors among the allies, in whose
territory the public domain was
situated, would be especially
affected, and in many cases in-
jured, by the agrarian reforms
proposed by the Gracchan party.
Scipio, in behalf of the Italians,
vigorously opposed in the senate
the new legislati0n3 cf. deAm. 12.

ferring to the various suspicions
concerning the death of Scipio;
see Intr. 11.—Laelius: C. Lae-
lius Sapiens (b. circ. 186 B.C.), a
man of marked culture and ability,
was the friend and companion of
the younger Scipio, as his father
had been of the emen—parum-
