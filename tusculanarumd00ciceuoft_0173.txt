CICERONIS

SOMNIVM SCIPIONIS

Cum in Africam venissem Μ’. Manilio consuli ad}
quartam legionem tribunus, ut scitis, militum, nihil mihi

fuit potius quam ut Masinissam convenirem regem,

familiae nostrae iustis de causis amicissimum.

Ad quem

ut veni, complexus me senex conlacrimavit aliquantoque
post suspexit ad caelum et ‘Grates' inquit ‘tibi ago,

1. 1. eum . . . venissem: at
the beginning of the Third Punic
WVar, 149 ΒΕ. At the close of
this war, 146 B.C., the territory
of Carthage (modern Tunis) was
organized as the Roman province
of Af1·ica.—M‘. Manilio con-
suli: Manius Manilius, consul
149 B.C.‚ with his colleague Cen-
sorinus had command of the
Roman forces during the first year
of the war, but made very little
progress toward the final reduction
of Carthage. Manilius was “a
man of] the forum rather than of
the camp.” Cicero introduces him
as one of the speakers in the De
Republica. For the dative (consuli
with tribunus) showing the rela-
tion in which one person stands to
another, see Madvig 241 Obs. 4.
—ad . . . legionem: for this use
of ad where we should expect apud,
cf. Caes. B. G. V. 5 3 ad exercitum
manere. —nihil . . . potius quam,
J ‹lesired nothing more than, —
Masinissam: Masinissa, king of

Numidia, in the first part of the
Second Punic War aided the Car-
thaginians against the Romans in
Spain, but in 204 13.c.' he became
the ally of the Romans under
Scipio in Africa. From this time
until his death, at the age of 90,
-148 ΒΩ, Masinissa remained a
firm friend of the Romans and a
treacherous and vindictive foe of
the Carthaginians.—iustis . . .
amicissimum: in the battle of
Zama, at the close of the Second
Punic XVar, 202 B.C., Masinissa
commanded a division of Roman
cavalry. In the treaty of peace
which followed he was recognized
as king of all Numidia, including
both his hereditary kingdom and
the greater part of the dominions
of Syphax, a former ally of Car-
thage. — conlacrimavit, wept copi-
‹asson—suspexit ad caelum: for
the omission of ad with suspicio,
cf. T usc. Ι. 62 astra suspeximus.
