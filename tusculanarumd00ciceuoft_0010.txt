Vi PREFACE

to illustrate peculiarities of language and style. A few

references to the grammars of Allen and Greenough‚ Lane,
and Madvig have been inserted.

The editions of Lemaire, Kiihner, Seyffert, Heine,
Tischer-Sorof, Hasper, and Schiche are the most service-
able editions of the Tusculan Disputations. From these
and from many special works on the history and develop-
ment οἱ ancient philosophy I have received valuable aid.
In the preparation of the commentary on Scipio’s Dream
the most assistance has been derived from the works of
Macrobius, the notes of Moser and Creuzer, and the
Lemaire, ΑΗΖ, and Meissner editions.

My thanks are especially due to Professors Clement L.
Smith and Tracy Peck, the editors-in-chief of this series,
for their careful criticism of the manuscript and for their
invaluable assistance in seeing the work through the press.
