xxxii INTRODUCTION

based upon these must fall short of actual demonstration.
The question, while an exceedingly interesting one and in
a sense important, can never be answered with any great
degree ot certainty. The new theories involve too much
speculation and too many debatable points to be accepted
without question3 and the conclusions reached, by appar-
ently careful scholars, are too far apart to give us absolute
confidence in the trustworthiness of any of them. The

labor devoted to this subject, however, has been in no

standing of Cicero’s method and to more exact knowledge
of the principles and theories of the different schools.

phy and the examples of eminent men that, in spite of all
the doubts and uncertainties of human experience, a calm
and contented life is possible.

different books there is, in reality‚ a certain degree of unity‚
