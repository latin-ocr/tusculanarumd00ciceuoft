ARGUMENT OF BOOK 1

ANALvsls

Ι. Introduction

1. Cicero's reasons for illustrating the principles of Greek
philosophy in Latin.
2. The subject of the book.

Ι Ι. Discussion

Refutation of the thesis that Death is an Evil.

1. Death is not an evil to the dead or the living.
a. The dead do not suffer3 the stories of terrible
punishments in the lower world are mere sables.
b. If death is annihilation, then
(ι) The dead are not unhappy, for they have no
feeling.
(2) The living need not sear death, for it can
bring no evil to them.
2. Death is not only not an evil, but is in reality a
blessing.
a. To prove this we must consider:
(ι) The nature of death.
(2) The nature of the soul.
b. Whatever theory in reference to these may be true,
death is not an evil, for
(1) If the soul is material and perishes, there is
no feeling after death.
Δ (2) If the soul is immortal‚ it is destined to be
happy, and therefore death is a blessing.
