that death is not an evil, but merely the harbor which all
must enter at the close of life's voyage.

32. In the remaining books philosophy is commended as
a source of comfort in afflieffion, a guide in doubt and per-
plexity. The second thesis for refutation is the doctrine
that pain is the greatest evil. The view of the Cyrenaics
and Epicureans, who so regard it, Cicero wholly rejects.
The Stoic teaching that pain must not be considered as an

this form of mental disturbance belongs to the lot of a wise
man is the thesis which Cicero undertakes to refute. After
briefly showing the falsity of the proposition by arguments
drawn for the most part from the Stoics, he enters into
a [ull discussion of aegritudo. The views of the different
schools in regard to mental suffering of this kind (aegritudo
