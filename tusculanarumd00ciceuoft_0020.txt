the ability and character of Cratippus so highly, it cannot be
said that the Peripatetic doctrines occupied a very large
place among the theories which he adopted.

7. With the teachings of the Stoics Cicero was thoroughly
conversant, both from his extended reading and his long
intercourse with the leading Stoics of his day. Their sys-
