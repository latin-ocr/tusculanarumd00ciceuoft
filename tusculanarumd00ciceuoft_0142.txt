VA RIANT READINGS

For a more complete apparatus criticas students are referred to the
works of Seyffert, Kiihner, and Schiche. The readings here given
include the most important variants in the best MSS. and editions
and the departures in this edition from the text of Muller.

In referring to editions, the following abbreviations are used:

rise. Kiihner’s view that the clause was a marginal note intended to
define more accurately the age of Livius is better. si qui B edd
