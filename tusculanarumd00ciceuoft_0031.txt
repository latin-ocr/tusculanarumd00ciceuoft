philosophical studies, he had certain special reasons sor
writing this particular treatise. In the l)c mnibus he had
considered the theoretical side of ethics in an attempt to
determine the ultimate grounds of good and evil and enun—
ciate the broad ethical principles on which human conduct
and duty must rest. Following this scientific study came
naturally the practical application of the doctrines formu-

existence is a happy life, in the truest and hest sense. To
secure this, man must know how to rid himself of the sear
of death and how to bear with courage and contentment
of spirit the ills that assail both body and mind. The
possibility aud true philosophy of such a life are set forth
in the 'l‘usculan Disputations. 'l'ullia’s death was still
fresh in mind, and the Com-olatio, written to lessen Cicero’s
grief, had vprepared him for a fuller and more thorough
discussion of the nature of death and the effective way to
rob it of its terrors. His abiding love for his daughter
and his deep-seated grief over her loss strengthened his
hope of immortality and inspired him to write, with deeper
feeling and clearer vision, of the separation of body and
spirit, of the life beyond the grave, and of the hope which
he entertained of rejoining his loved ones and meeting the
great and good of all the ages. The work was not written
as a scientific treatise for the instruction of philosophers‚
but rather for the aid and comfort of thoughtful men who
wish to learn the secret of living well and happily‚ and how
to meet death without fear or despair.
