xliv INTRODUCTION

93—101. It is absurd to think those unhappy who die
before their time. Life has been given to man with-
out any fixed limit. Nature may recall her gift at any
moment. Long and short, as applied to life, are merely
relative terms. Right living depends upon nobility of
soul and calls for the exercise of every virtue. The exam-
ple of Theramenes, Socrates, and the Spartans, in presence
of death.

102—108. The form of burial and the observance of
funeral rites are really immaterial and should occasion
no anxiety, for they cannot in any way affect the dead.
The words of Socrates, Diogenes, and others on this point.
The burial customs of certain nations.

109—111. Death is met with calmest mind by those
who have lived honorable and useful lives, whether their
days have been many or few. Glory is the shadow of
virtue. Inspired by the example of the brave and good,
the wise will meet death unflinchingly. They will even
welcome it in the hour of greatest success, lest they be sub-
jected too long to the will of fortune—Ciceros reasons
for prolonging the discussion beyond the required limits.

112-119. Epilogue. The judgments of the immortal
gods concerning death. In answer to prayers for the
best gift to man within their power to bestow, they have
sent death. Books in praise of death. Examples of men
and women who have willingly sacrificed their lives for
the benefit of their country. Whether the soul lives for-
ever, or perishes with the body, there is no evil in death.
What has been ordained by the gods, or by nature, the
common parent of all, cannot be evil. Death a haven of
refuge which all must enter at the close of life's voyage. —
Subjects to be discussed on the following days.
