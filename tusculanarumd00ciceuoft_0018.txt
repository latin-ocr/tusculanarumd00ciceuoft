the philosophers, and by contributing toward his general
literary development ultimately aided him in the prepara-
tion of his rhetorical and philosophical treatises. From
Diodotus the Stoic, who lived with him many years and
died at his home, 59 Bc, Cicero received constant encour-
agement and assistance in his philosophica} studies, and
special training in logic, in which the Stoics excelled.
4. Cicero’s early instruction in the elementary principles
of Greek philosophy was supplementcd later by a wide
range of reading, embracing numerous authors and many
works. Some books he translated directly‚ as the Timaeus
of Plato. Others he made the basis of his own composi-
tions, as, for example, Panaetius On Dusy was the model
for the De Officiis. His frequent allusions to Greek writers
and his many quotations from them would seem to indi-
cate at-least a general familiarity with the authors and
with the leading features of their works. How many of
these he knew thoroughly and at first hand has often
been the subject of discussion, but probably will never be
answered in a manner entirely satisfactory. His own state-
ments are not sufficiently clear and definite to settle the
question, while the loss of many of the original works
removes the surest test of his acquaintance with them.
A careful study of his different treatises for the purpose
of determining their sources shows that, in addition to a
large number of the more popular and less distinguished
writers on Greek philosophy, including many of the later
representatives of the different schools, he borrowed, either
directly or at second hand, from more than a score of the
most eminent authors. Among these may be mentioned
Plato, Aristotle, Speusippus, Theophrastus, Xenocrates,
Crantor, Cleanthes, ChrysippuS, Carneades, Panaetius,
Hecaton, Posidonius, Philo, and Antiochus. That Cicero
pursued his reading with something like a definite system
