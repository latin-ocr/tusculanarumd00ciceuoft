xlii INTRODUCTION

encumbrance of the body, is destined to enjoy a happy
existence. Here it may satisfy its desire for knowledge
and behold with the spiritual eye things which have never
been revealed to mortal vision. Cicero believes the doc-
trines of Pythagoras and Plato to be true; but whether
true or false, their teaching is more noble and inspiring
than the idle theories of the Epicureans. Plato's authority
is sufficient to convince Cicero.

50—55. Many believe the soul mortal‚ because they
cannot comprehend its nature apart and separate from
the body. But they do not understand it any better even
while it is in the body. The soul is the man; the body
is simply the soul's receptacle‚ its temporary home. The
true meaning of the words “ Know thyself.'' Plato's argu-
ment for the immortality of the soul‚ based upon the
original activity of the soul.

56-66. The soul possesses certain divine characteris-
tics. It means more than the life principle of plants or
the instinct of animals. It is endowed with memory in
its widest sense, which Plato interprets as the recollec-
tion of the soul's former existence. This is shown when
children learn many things so quickly; for learning, Plato
maintains, is simply recalling. The powers of the soul‚ the
achievements of man in the amelioration of his physical
condition, his attainments in science, in literature, and
philosophy, all prove the divine origin of the soul. An
argument from the De Consolatione to show that the soul
is both divine and immortal.

67-76. Where is the soul and what is its character?
We can see its works, though we cannot see the soul itself.
When we behold the beauty and order of the universe, we
cannot doubt that there is a Divine Ruler, whose character
can be seen in his works. In like manner the nature of
the soul is revealed‚ in part at least, to our understanding.
