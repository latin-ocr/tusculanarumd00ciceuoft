20. In the introduction to the Tusculan Disputations
Cicero states his reasons for devoting the closing years of
his life to philosophy. He has expressed similar thoughts
in other passages, especially in the opening chapters of
the second and third books of the De Officiis, in which he
defended himself from criticism and justified his philo-
sophical studies on practical and convincing grounds. So
long as the Republic stood in its integrity and secured to
citizens their constitutional rights, Cicero devoted himself
without reserve to the interests of the state. But when
civil war overwhelmed the namon, and Caesar by force of
arms made himself the absolute head of the government‚

of his beloved Tullia. Disappointment and grief drove
him to philosophy, as a source of consolation and hope.
With renewed application to these congenial studies his
old interest revived, and he determined not merely to seek
solace for himself in his hour of trial and adversity, but to
develop a body of philosophica] literature founded on the
best works of the Greek sages. With this purpose in mind
he taught his countrymen‚ in terms which they could under-
