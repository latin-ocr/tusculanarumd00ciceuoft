and bound to him by the closest ties of friendship stood
Gaius Laelius, chosen by Cicero in the De Amicitia to
expound the principles and rules of friendship and to por-
tray the public and private virtues of Scipio, the model
friend.

11. The circumstances surrounding the death of Scipio,
129 uc„ have always been shrouded in mystery. He had
been the acknowledged leader of the opposition to the
agrarian laws of Tiberius Gracchus. Even the violent
death of the latter he had declared justifiable. But the
act which aroused the anger of the Gracchan party most
strongly was a decree of the senate, proposed by Scipio,
amounting practically to a nullification of all the recent
legislation on the public lands. The supervision of the
public domain was to be taken out of the hands of
the commissioners who had been appointed under the
reform laws and given to the consuls. On the last day
of his life Scipio addressed the senate in defense of his
acts and announced his policy in reference to the agrarian
laws. At evening he was conducted home in triumph by
the senators and wealthy landholders whose interests he
had defended. On the following morning his dead body
was found lying on his couch. The popular party was
charged with his death, and suspicion rested upon his
wife Sempronia, who was the sister of Tiberius Gracchus,
and upon the commissioners, Fulvius, Carbo, and Gaius
Gracchus. The case against Carbo was the strongest, but
the complete story of Scipio's death has never come to
light. His brilliant career and tragic end lend impres-
siveness and dramatic coloring to the Dream.
