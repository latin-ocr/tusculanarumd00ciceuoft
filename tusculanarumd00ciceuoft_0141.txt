MANUSCRIPTS ΛΝΙ) EDITIONS

Of the numerous Manuscripts (more than fifty) through which the
Tusculanae Disputationes have come down to us, two easily excel all
others in importance:

Codex Gudianus (G), of the ninth or tenth century, at Wolsenbiittel.
Codex Regius (R), of the ninth century, at Paris.

Next to these, in point of value, are the Bruxellensis (Β), of the
twelfth century, and the Vaticanus (K), of the ninth century.

The Gudianus and the Regius have been carefully collated and in the
main agree. Their close resemblance, however, does not indicate that
one of them was derived from the other, but that both have come from
a common source. Internal evidence, in the form of interpolation and
omission, warrants us in concluding that all the Manuscripts have
descended from one codex.

The editio princeps was published at Rome by Ulrie Hahn of Vienna,
1469. The second edition, fol„ was published at Paris by Gen'ng,
Crantz‚ and Friburg, about 1471. Many others appeared in the fif-
teenth and sixteenth centuries.
