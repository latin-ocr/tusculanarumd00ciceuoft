The soul is a unit, pure and simple. It cannot be divided
and therefore cannot perish. Influenced by such reasons
as these, Socrates, on the last day of his life, avowed his
belief in the immortality of the soul. Cato departed from
life as if glad that he had found just cause for suicide. The
whole life of philosophers is a preparation for death. Death
itself is but the entrance to an eternal life with the gods.

77—81. This doctrine some philosophers deny. The
Stoics grant long life to the soul but not eternal life.
They are inconsistent in that they admit the most difficult
part of the doctrine, namely, that the soul survives the
body, but claim that after long lapse of time it perishes.
Panaetius held that the soul is born, suffers, and therefore
must be mortal. This theory is based upon confusion of
terms and is easily refuted.

82-86. Even if the soul dies with the body, death must
not be considered an evi13 for on this supposition the soul
could not suffer after death, and the pain of dissolution‚ if
felt at all, lasts only for a brief time. What really disturbs
the mind is the fact that death is a departure from every-
thing desirable in life. But it also withdraws us from the
ills and misfortunes of life. If one dies in the hour of his
greatest triumph, he escapes the possible calamities which
the future might otherwise have in store for him.

87—92. The dead are not deprived of the blessing of life,
in the true sense of the word3 for man cannot be deprived
of that of which he does not feel the need. Soldiers on
many battlefields have met death without fear. If soul
and body perish together, the dead suffer no more than
the mythical beings which never had any real existence.
Death does not deter the wise from consulting for the
future welfare of their country. Even one who thinks
the soul mortal may attempt immortal works. Sleep is the
image of death. The story of Endymion.
