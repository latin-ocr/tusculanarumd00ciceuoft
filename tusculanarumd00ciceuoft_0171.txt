6. Africanus again urges Scipio to lift his eyes from
earth to heaven and shows him the narrow limits within
which human fame is contained. The earth is occupied
only in spots, as it were. Of the five zones but two

remotest limits.

7. Future fame is limited in time by the impending
destruction of the world through flood and tire. A man’s
fame cannot be known to those who have lived before him,
nor will it endure through one great year. The great year
is equal to many thousand ordinary years. Disregarding
the praises of rnen, one should seek for the lasting rewards
of an upright life.

8. Scipio, having from boyhood emulated the virtues of
Paulus and Africanus, pledges himself to strivestill more

the body alone is mortal‚ the soul divine. As the supreme
god rules the universe, so the soul controls the body.
Plato’s argument for the immortality of the soul, based

9. The conclusion of Plato’s argument. Africanus urges
Scipio to devote himself to noble deeds, that at death his
soul may pass at once to its eternal home. The spirits of
men who have surrendered themselves wholly to base pas-
sions reach heaven only after a long lapse of time and
severe punishment. “He vanished; I awoke from my
dream.’'
