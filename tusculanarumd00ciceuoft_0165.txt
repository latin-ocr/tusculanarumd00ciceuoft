that no statue or public memorial had been crected in
honor of Scipio Nasica in return for his courageous and
patriotic service in leading the attack on Tiberius Grac-
chus. To this criticism Scipio replies that while the con-
sciousness of honorable service is a sufficient reward to

permixti cum corpore animi videre non possunt. Cicero's good
taste in preferring the dream to any other less human and
less natural method of revelation, and his selection of
