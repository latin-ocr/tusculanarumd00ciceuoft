of death, as shown in the case of Theramenes,

SUMMARY
[The numbers refer to sections of the text]

1-8. Cicero, addressing Brutus, gives his reasons for
resuming his studies, and states his purpose to illustrate
to the Romans in their own language the principles of
Greek philosophy. In the practica] affairs of life and in
all the manly virtues the Romans have shown themselves
superior to the Greeks. In literature, music, and art the
Greeks have easily excelled ; in oratory the attainments of
the two nations have been very nearly equal. Philosophy,
hitherto neglected by the Romans, offers Cicero a special
opportunity to render important service to his countrymen.
For five days, in company with friends at his Tusculan villa,
he carried on a series of philosophica] discussions. These
are reproduced in dialogue form in five books.

9—14. Death seems to be an evil, both to the dead and
to the living. This thesis Cicero seeks to refute3 show-
ing first that it is not true in the case of the dead, for the
terrible punishments of the lower world have no existence
