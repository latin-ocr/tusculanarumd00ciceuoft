while gathered about him is a company of congenial com-
panions, including Laelius, his most devoted friend, the
consul Manilius, Mucius Scaevola, the augur, Fannius, son-
in-law of Laelius, Quintus Tubero, Isurius Philus, Spurius
Mummius, brother of Achaicus, and Rutilius Rufus. These
men differed much in age and experience, but ranked
among the best citizens of the commonwealth, either by
virtue of their personal achievements or in consequence

is Cicero in carrying out the illusion in his dialogues that

scenes are purely imaginary.

3. That the six books of the De Republim contained
valuable material on the general subject of political science
cannot be doubted, but the greater portion of the work was
lost, probably early in the Middle Ages, and for a long
time, with the exception of Scipio’s Dream, only brief frag-
ments were known to be in existence. But in 1820 Angelo
Mai discovered in the Vatican Library a palimpsest of
great age (probably of the fourth or fifth century) which
contains, underneath a commentary on the Psalms by
St. Augustine‚ about one third of the missing portions of
the De Repzcblica. As a result of this remarkable find,
the editio princeps was published by Mai at Rome, 1822.
A more complete and fully annotated edition of all the
fragments, including Mai's find, was prepared by Moser
and Creuzer and published at Frankfort, 1826. This edi-
tion has been the storehouse from which modern editors
have largely drawn.
