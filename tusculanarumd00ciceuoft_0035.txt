Plato, Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemo, and the Lyceum
by Aristotle and 'l'heophrastus3 while arguments based on
the general doctrines of the Stoics are also introduced,
and (in the last part of the book) certain theories of the
Epicureans.

27, This outline of the sources of Cicero's material pre-
supposes familiarity on his part with the works of many
authors and ability to draw from these in the rapid course
of his writing whatever he needed sor the development of
his theme and the support os his argument. But the
theory that he used these authorities directly ancl in this
way has been vigorously attacked by different scholam,
especially by P. Corssen (Bonn, 1878), l'oppelreuter (Bonn,
1883), and Hirzel (Leipzig, 1883). Corssen (Dz'ss. and lx'lzet'n.
Mus. XXXVI. 506 ff.) and Poppelreuter (Dz'ss.) maintain
that Cicero made a single work of Posidonius his model and
drew from it his material. Hirzel (crbztersmlz. zu Cicero's
plzil. Sclzr„ Vol. III) combats this theory at considerable
length and seeks to prove that Cicero followed Philo of
Larissa, the Academic, one of his early teachers‚ intro-
ducing, however, in the course of the work arguments
and illustrations gathered in his general reading. Other
authorities have been suggested, but Posidonius and Philo
have met with the most favor from critics inclined to dis-
card the old views.

28. The real question to be decided is briefly this: Did
Cicero make one author the basis of the Tusculan Disputa-
tions in the same way that he followed Panaetius in the
De Officiis, or did he draw from whatever sources suited his
purpose? There is no statement in the text sufficiently
full and definite to render a settlement of the controversy
possible by an appeal to Cicero himself. The works of
Posidonius and Philo and many of the other Greek philoso-
phers are very imperfectly known to us, and any theory
